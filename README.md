This repo was never meant to be seen by public eyes but here it is in all its messy glory.

Its main function was to collect a lot of data through MiHoYo's public API endpoints. But there was a rate limit of around 30 requests per day per user, and I was hoping to make tens of thousands of requests within a reasonable time frame. They also did not have any support for developers in using their APIs.
So I did what normal people would do and looked for another solution, such as crowdsourcing the data through surveys or similar means.

What I actually did was automate the creation of accounts to obtain have multiple tokens to cycle through once I hit the rate limit. I wasn't unable to automate solving CAPTCHAs so the accounts I created were <50. So kind of a menace, but not quite competent enough.
After this highly questionable act I was able to collect data from tens of thousands of users (indiscriminately and all from users that voluntarily set their data public) and aggregate them to find meaningful information and present them nicely.

This was a lot of effort that mostly went to waste since MiHoYo eventually decided to exclude the most important data (such as teams used in endgame content) but it was the journey, or the friends along--actually no it was just a complete waste of time.
This repository here exists as a reminder that just because I could doesn't mean I should.
